++ My business idea

I would start a company called Brazilian Flavor that would sell ingredients for typical Brazilian meals, like "feijoada", "camarão na moranga" (prawns in a pumpkin), "churrasco" (Brazilian barbecue), etc. These ingredients would be delivered chopped, washed and portioned and all you have to do is pour in your magic (a recipe with instructions is included). The recipes would be labeled according to degree of difficulty to execute, from “unexperienced cook” to “skilled cook”.
What makes this company different is that you wouldn’t have to subscribe for recurrent service, you would be able to buy whenever you want, everything you want. We would offer typical Brazilian food for all meals (breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinner), as well as deserts and beverages (like “capirinha”).
Since it is really difficult to find some ingredients here people don’t always know where to find or how to choose them. I believe this would be a great chance for people to taste different flavors.
